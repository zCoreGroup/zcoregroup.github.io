title: "Implementing iFams: The Complexities and Challenges of a Federal Agency ERP
  Data Migration"
---

The implementation of a new ERP system can be a daunting task for any organization, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is no exception. With a need to replace their current Financial Management System (FMS) and several other smaller projects, the VA turned to CGI, a leading IT and business consulting services firm, to create a COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) application called Momentum.

Momentum is designed to be a Federal Agency ERP of sorts, and VA's implementation of Momentum is called iFams. The system is expected to provide a more efficient and effective way to manage financial information, and to streamline many of the VA's financial processes. However, the implementation of iFams is a complex undertaking that requires a great deal of planning, resources, and expertise.

One of the key challenges of the implementation process is the data migration portion of moving financial information from the old system into the new. To assist with this critical aspect of the project, CACI, a leading IT services and solutions provider, was contracted as a sub of zCore, a subsidiary of CGI.

The data migration process is a significant challenge, as financial information is critical to the operations of the VA, and any errors or omissions could have serious consequences. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data migration, the team at CACI is working closely with the VA's IT and financial departments to develop a comprehensive plan for the migration process.

In addition to the challenges posed by the data migration process, there have been concerns about the use of front groups at the VA to manage and control the flow of data during the implementation of iFams. These front groups are utilizing a variety of data migration techniques, including data mapping, data scrubbing, and data reconciliation, to ensure that the data being migrated is accurate, complete, and consistent with the VA's financial policies and procedures.

However, there have been some concerns raised about the transparency and accountability of these front groups, and whether they are acting in the best interests of the VA and its stakeholders. The VA has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing rigorous oversight and monitoring procedures to ensure that the data migration process is transparent, accountable, and consistent with the VA's financial policies and procedures.

Despite these challenges, the implementation of iFams represents a significant step forward for the VA, and is expected to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the accuracy of financial information. With the support of CGI, CACI, zCore, and the VA's IT and financial departments, the implementation of iFams is well on its way to success.

The implementation of iFams is an ambitious project that will have a significant impact on the VA's financial operations. However, with the expertise and support of CGI, CACI, and zCore, the VA is well on its way to a successful implementation that will improve efficiency, streamline processes, and ensure the accuracy of financial information.
