title: 'GitHub Projects: The Ultimate Tool for Agile Project Management'
---

GitHub Projects is a reincarnation of the original GitHub, but with a new focus on project management. The objective of GitHub Projects is to put the control back in the teams' hands. The developers behind GitHub Projects wanted to create a tool that allows flexibility for methodology and let tasks flow without using methodology but still using the same kind of functionality.

This is in contrast to tooled methodologies like Lean Agile and Jira, which are more rigid and require certain things to be approved before tasks can be completed. This can slow down productivity and make it difficult to adapt to changing project requirements.

GitHub Projects, on the other hand, provides a customizable platform where teams can set fields to whatever they want them to be, name anything whatever they want, change size, font, colors to whatever they want, and all in custom fields. It's easy to navigate different milestones, show sprints, and you can even show start dates and end dates. You can filter things with key words, and more.

One of the standout features of GitHub Projects is its flexibility. With customizable fields and labels, teams can use GitHub Projects for any type of project management, not just software development. Whether you're managing a marketing campaign or a product launch, GitHub Projects can be tailored to fit your needs.

Another great feature of GitHub Projects is the ability to constantly improve and add new features. The GitHub team is always listening to feedback from their users and implementing changes to make the platform even more useful.

For software development teams, GitHub Projects is a must-have tool. It provides an easy-to-use platform for project management that can be customized to fit any team's needs. And with the ability to track milestones, sprints, and deadlines, it's easier than ever to stay on top of your project timeline.

Overall, GitHub Projects is a powerful tool for project management. It's useful for any team that wants to have more control over their projects and improve their productivity. If you're looking for a flexible and customizable project management tool, GitHub Projects is definitely worth checking out.
