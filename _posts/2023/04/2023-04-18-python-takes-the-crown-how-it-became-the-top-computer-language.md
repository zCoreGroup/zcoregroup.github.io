title: 'Python Takes the Crown: How It Became the Top Computer Language'
---

For many years, JavaScript has been the dominant programming language among software developers worldwide. However, in December 2021, Python rose to the top of the list of the most used programming languages. This is a significant milestone for Python, as it has been steadily gaining popularity over the past few years.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for general-purpose programming. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

One of the reasons why Python has become so popular is its versatility. It can be used for a wide range of applications, such as web development, data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. For example, it is used by companies such as Google, Instagram, and Spotify to build and maintain their applications and services.

Python has many features that make it an excellent choice for programming. Its syntax is clean and straightforward, which makes it easy to read and write code. Python also has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, which makes it well-suited for a wide range of applications. Additionally, Python has excellent support for object-oriented programming, which allows developers to write code that is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

Python's rise to the top of the most used programming languages can be seen in both the [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and [PYPL](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html/) indices. TIOBE is a measure of programming language popularity based on the number of search engine results for a given language. According to TIOBE, Python is currently the top programming language, followed by Java and C. PYPL, on the other hand, ranks programming languages based on the frequency of searches for their tutorials on Google. Python is currently the most popular language on the PYPL index, followed by JavaScript and Java.

The reasons why software developers would want to use Python are numerous. For one, it is easy to learn and use, making it a great choice for beginners. Additionally, Python has an active and supportive community that provides resources, tutorials, and libraries for developers. Python is also a great choice for scientific and data-driven applications because of its extensive libraries for data analysis and visualization, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Finally, Python's versatility means that it can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to machine learning, making it an excellent choice for any software developer.
