title: ' Migrating to VA Enterprise Cloud: What You Need to Know'
---

In a constant pursuit of enhanced user experience and improved security measures, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is embarking on a significant migration journey. On May 26, 2023, the VA OIT DevOps Tools Team (DOTS) will bid farewell to MAX.GOV hosting and migrate the VA's Jira and Confluence platforms to the VA Enterprise Cloud (VAEC), DevOps Tools Enclave (DTE). This blog post aims to provide you with all the essential information regarding this migration and what you, as a user, need to know.

## The Migration Process:
At precisely 1700 on May 26th, access to the current Jira and Confluence instances on MAX.GOV will cease. However, fear not, for the migration process has been designed to be seamless and user-friendly. Once the migration is complete, you will be able to access Jira and Confluence using the new domain without any hassle. There will be no need to re-establish your profiles or access to Jira. Instead, a new OKTA interface will be introduced to streamline the sign-in process.

## Enhanced User Experience:
This migration holds several advantages that will significantly enhance your experience with Jira and Confluence. Firstly, it ensures compliance with VA's stringent security standards for access controls, providing you with peace of mind while working with these tools. Additionally, the migration enables the implementation of a highly available architecture for these Atlassian products, reducing potential downtimes and increasing reliability. Furthermore, by consolidating support and maintenance efforts, this migration streamlines the administration and upkeep of these mission-critical tools, ultimately benefiting you as a user.

## Access to MAX.Gov Confluence/Community:
Following the migration, users will have read-only access to MAX.Gov Confluence/Community. Although you won't be able to make changes or contributions on the old platform, it will serve as a valuable resource for reference purposes.

## Project Migration Details:
All existing projects in the MAX.GOV Jira instance will be migrated to VAEC DTE between May 26th and May 29th, 2023. This migration process is estimated to take approximately 3 1/2 days. Importantly, the links between Confluence and Jira will be maintained during and after the migration, ensuring the continuity of your collaborative workflows.

## Next Steps for Users:
To ensure a smooth transition, please ensure that the information in your current project(s) is up to date before May 26th, 5 pm EST. It is crucial to review and make any necessary updates to avoid any data discrepancies during the migration process. Additionally, be on the lookout for further communication regarding the establishment of your new account. Detailed instructions, both in written and recorded formats, will be shared via email, Slack, and Teams to guide you through the account setup process.
