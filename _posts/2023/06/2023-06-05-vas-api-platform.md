title: 'VAâ€™s API Platform: Seamless and Secure Access to VA Data for Veterans, Their
  Families, and Advocates'
---

Planning a vacation has never been easier. With just a few clicks, you can find hundreds of flights tailored to your needs. This convenience is made possible by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which play a crucial role in allowing apps and platforms to access, share, and control data across the web. APIs effortlessly compile information from various sources and present it to users in one centralized location, saving time and effort. Just as APIs simplify travel planning, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has harnessed their power to improve the connection between Veterans and VA services.

In 2018, the VA's Office of Information and Technology (OIT) launched a publicly available API platform that aims to provide an easy-to-use and accessible way for developers to build applications benefiting Veterans. The VA API platform operates on the same principle as the flight search example: it pulls data and services from the VA into a unified platform, eliminating the need for Veterans to navigate multiple interfaces to access information and resources. Through this platform, developers can create innovative solutions, ranging from mobile applications to web-based tools and chatbots, that enhance Veterans' access to VA services and improve their overall experience.

From its inception to the present day, the VA Lighthouse Program has been at the forefront of VA's digital modernization strategy. Since August 2018, the VA has been continuously expanding its catalog of publicly available APIs, ensuring they are secure, reliable, and easy to use. The development of the VA API platform adheres to several guiding principles: user-centered design, agile development, open standards, and security and privacy.

User-centered design serves as the foundation of the platform, prioritizing usability, accessibility, and ease of use. The development process itself follows an agile and iterative approach, incorporating frequent feedback and collaboration among different teams and stakeholders. By utilizing open standards and technologies, the VA ensures interoperability, portability, and extensibility, fostering a seamless integration between the platform and other systems. Robust security and privacy features, such as encryption, identity verification, and access controls, safeguard sensitive data and protect against unauthorized access.

Presently, the VA APIs provide easier and safer access to various categories of VA data, including health, facilities, forms, and Veteran verification. The VA continues to actively expand its API library, aiming to better serve those who have served us. Moreover, the VA API developer portal offers comprehensive documentation, consumer onboarding support, and API publishing assistance, facilitating developers in leveraging the power of VA's data and services.

The API development cycle for VA APIs entails an extensive cross-functional product development process involving product, engineering, and user experience (UX) specialists. This cycle encompasses discovery, build and validate phases, and the evolve phase. During discovery, the team delves into the problem space and tests assumptions through UX research. The build and validate phases involve shaping the solution, architecting the API, and refining it based on feedback from other developers. In the evolve phase, the team enhances the usability of the API through usability testing and early user research, aligning the product with commercial industry standards.

Operating at the highest levels, the VA API platform demonstrates operational excellence that aligns with private sector industry standards. The platform offers a centralized location for developers to access VA data and services, reducing duplicate efforts and minimizing the time and cost required for application development. Enhanced security features protect sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access it. Furthermore, the platform fosters interoperability, enabling seamless integration between VA systems and third-party applications. By promoting standardized best practices for API development, documentation, and maintenance, the Lighthouse API platform ensures the overall quality and consistency of the APIs and the applications that utilize them.

The VA API platform exemplifies VA's commitment to modernizing its digital infrastructure to better serve Veterans' needs. By harnessing the power of APIs, the VA drives innovation, provides greater access to information and resources, and improves the delivery of services to Veterans. It stands as a testament to the VA's ability to adapt and excel in the rapidly evolving technology landscape while ensuring a delightful user experience for both VA front-line staff and Veterans.
