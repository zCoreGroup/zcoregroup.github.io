title: "Decoding the Jira and Confluence Migration from Max.Gov to Okta: A Comprehensive Summary"
---

Greetings, fellow seekers of knowledge! Today, I bring you the key points from the recent DOTS Tools and Technology presentation. As a neutral note taker, my aim is to simply relay the facts and information presented during the meeting. Let's delve into the world of DevOps, ALM, Jira, Confluence, and Okta, as shared in this insightful gathering.

##### Migration to the New Environment:
The meeting began with a discussion on the migration from Max.Gov to Okta for Jira and Confluence. This migration is scheduled for May 26th, and the DevOps Team and ALM Team Lead showcased the capabilities on the Confluence page related to this transition. They also mentioned the integration of Department of Veterans Affairs Okta.

##### Okta Login Process:
To access the new environment, users need to submit a request to Okta and Jira. Upon approval, they will receive an email from Okta with a link that remains active for 7 days. The first-time login process involves entering a username, password, and completing an email verification. Users can sign in via the organization's sign-in page, dots-va.okta.com, and access their projects by clicking on applications. The login process is similar to using PIV (Personal Identity Verification).

##### Confluence Updates and Changes:
The presenter demonstrated the new DOTS tools information page on Confluence. The transition involved moving from community.max.gov to confluence.devops.va.gov. The changes were aimed at enhancing the website's look and feel for easier navigation. Attachments and child pages are now displayed in breadcrumbs on the right side, and DOTS ANNOUNCEMENTS now contain child pages. "Favorites" have been renamed to "Saved for Later" and can be found on the dashboard. In-house macros have been migrated and marked as VA instead of MAX, and the search functionality has been improved with an array of filters.

##### Jira Known Issues and Resolutions:
Post-migration, some users faced challenges with loading and viewing attachments. Investigation revealed that the VA firewall was impacting the uploading process. To resolve this, the Jira Admins worked with the VA to set up acceptors outside the VPN. Users without Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) experienced fewer issues. Time rendering and specific date problems related to different time zones were mitigated. Users experiencing issues were encouraged to create tickets for further investigation.

##### Confluence Templates and DOTS Service Request:
Confluence now offers templates, and additional templates can be created upon request. Users can submit a DOTS service request to their team, simplifying page creation.

The DOTS Tools and Technology presentation shed light on important aspects of the migration, Okta login process, Confluence updates, Jira known issues, and templates. As a neutral note taker, I present these facts to you, allowing you to explore and make informed decisions in your respective roles. May these insights serve you well on your journey through the world of DevOps and ALM!
