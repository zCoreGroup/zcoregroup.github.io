---

## **Building Bridges in Government Contracting**

Last week, *zCore Group* had the privilege of attending the **National Veterans Small Business Engagement (NVSBE) 2023**. This event, held under the theme _"Building Access, Dismantling Barriers,"_ was a hub for companies like ours to connect with government opportunities. Our goal was to:

- **Network** with peers and leaders
- **Showcase** our capabilities
- **Understand** the intricacies of government contracting processes

## **A Glimpse into the Agenda**

The NVSBE conference was a bustling environment with a range of learning sessions and workshops. zCore participated in various discussions that provided valuable insights into current market trends and government needs. 

> One of the key talks was about the upcoming **SPRUCE IDIQ**, an initiative aimed at enhancing the government's ability to procure products efficiently. 

This session was particularly informative, shedding light on the transition from the existing *CEDAR program* to *SPRUCE*, which anticipates expanding the number of participating companies.

Another significant session involved discussions around **software factories**, where VA delved into the need for accelerated software development and deployment. The focus on automating software processes and the challenges in cloud and cybersecurity engineering were eye-openers, highlighting areas where zCore could contribute.

## **Engaging with Industry Leaders and Government Representatives**

Apart from the structured sessions, the conference offered a platform for one-on-one interactions with various leaders and government representatives. This allowed us to gain first-hand knowledge of the technical challenges and service needs within various VA programs. The insights gathered from these interactions were invaluable, helping us to better understand the landscape of government contracting.

## **Key Takeaways and zCore's Outlook**

_The NVSBE 2023 was more than just an event for us; it was a learning experience that helped us refine our strategies and approaches in the field of government contracting._ We got a clearer picture of the current needs in government services, especially in:

- **Software development** and modernization
- **Data governance**
- **IT services**

While we actively engaged in various sessions, our focus remained on understanding the broader spectrum of opportunities and challenges in the government sector. This approach aligns with our commitment to creating accessible and inclusive business environments, especially for veteran-owned businesses.

_Attending the NVSBE 2023 was a step forward for zCore Group in our journey._ The event provided us with a deeper understanding of the sector's dynamics and the evolving needs of government agencies. As we continue to forge our path in this field, the insights and connections we gained at the NVSBE will undoubtedly play a crucial role in our future endeavors.
